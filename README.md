# CNN Model with VGG16 Architecture
This project provides an overview and guidance for implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on the VGG16 architecture using the CIFAR-10 dataset. VGG16 is a widely used CNN architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a CNN model based on the VGG16 architecture for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

## Dependencies
- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Getting Started
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChieBKAI/cnn-model-with-vgg16-architecture.git
cd cnn-vgg16-cifar10
```

## VGG16 Architecture Overview
VGG16 is a deep convolutional neural network architecture that gained popularity for its simplicity and strong performance. It consists of 13 convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers. The architecture is known for using small 3x3 convolutional filters with a stride of 1 for feature extraction.
